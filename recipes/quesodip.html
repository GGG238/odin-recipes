        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rich, creamy, with bits of spice and tang from jalapeno peppers--this dip is just like the good stuff you get in restaurants but you'll get 3 to 4 times the amount for the same price.</p>
        <p>Serve with crispy light tortilla chips, or over nachos, a burrito, or heck, even a shoe it's so good!</p>
