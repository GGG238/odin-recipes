        <img src="../img/queso.jpeg" width="450">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rich, creamy, with bits of spice and tang from jalapeno peppers--this dip is just like the good stuff you get in restaurants but you'll get 3 to 4 times the amount for the same price.</p>
        <p>Serve with crispy light tortilla chips, or over nachos, a burrito, or heck, even a shoe it's so good!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound white American cheese, cubed.</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon pickled jalapeno pepper juice</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
