        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Mexican fritters are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oi</li>l
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Stir in flour until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pipe 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil using a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Do not overcrowd the oil. Fry until golden; drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
